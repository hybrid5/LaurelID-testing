# LaurelID Pilot Readiness Report

## Executive Summary
- CI workflow now provisions the Android SDK, runs lint/ktlint/detekt, executes unit tests, and assembles the release APK artifact automatically.
- Added deterministic `local.properties` generation so runners and developers use the provisioned SDK path instead of a hard-coded workstation path.
- Captured kiosk-hardening gaps (DeviceAdminReceiver, lock-task watchdog, crash loop recovery) and mapped them to blocking backlog items.
- Documented the migration path from placeholder QR JSON parsing to real ISO 18013-5 device engagement and BLE/NFC transport.
- Defined COSE + SD-JWT validation steps with trust list caching strategy and stale-cache eviction policy.
- Outlined secure admin PIN enrollment flow (entropy checks, rotation deadlines, recovery) for first-boot provisioning.
- Proposed Espresso smoke tests that cover lock task entry, camera permission consent, and admin unlock gesture/PIN verification.
- Produced a comprehensive security checklist with remediation owners and sign-off criteria.
- Established go/no-go pilot criteria tying functional, resilience, and security validation to rollout readiness.

## Prioritized Backlog
### P0 – Pilot Blockers
1. Implement `DeviceAdminReceiver` + enforce lock-task entry/re-entry, immersive sticky UI, and crash watchdog auto-relaunch.
2. Replace JSON mock parsing with full ISO 18013-5 engagement (QR bootstrap → BLE/NFC) and COSE/SD-JWT validation against trust list.
3. Enforce secure admin PIN provisioning on first boot (no default) with entropy/rotation policy and emergency recovery tooling.
4. Harden local storage & logging for PII minimization (age-over-only decisioning, encrypted persistence, bounded retention).

### P1 – Launch Critical
1. Expand CI to run instrumented Espresso smoke tests on emulator farm and surface video/screenshots for triage.
2. Build telemetry back-pressure handling and retry policies for offline kiosks feeding backend ingestion API.
3. Integrate trust list refresh scheduling with stale cache purge + exponential backoff on network failure.
4. Implement crash-loop detection + health metrics export (structured logs & Prometheus endpoint via watchdog service).

### P2 – Post-Launch Enhancements
1. Support remote admin PIN rotation and remote wipe via secure messaging channel.
2. Add hardware attestation (KeyMint/StrongBox) verification and certificate pinning for backend calls.
3. Provide operator UX polish: accessibility gestures, visual timers, multilingual hints.
4. Implement in-app OTA module updates guarded by Play Integrity verdicts.

## Proposed PRs
1. **"chore(ci): harden workflow and deterministic SDK setup"**  
   *Rationale:* Ensure GitHub Actions can build/test artifacts reproducibly without developer-specific SDK paths.  
   *Diff summary:*  
   - `.github/workflows/android-ci.yml`: collapse to single build job, run `ciStaticAnalysis`, `ciUnitTest`, assemble release, upload APK.  
   - `scripts/write_local_properties.sh`: new helper to author `local.properties` from `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/ANDROID_HOME`.  
   - `.gitignore`: ignore `app/local.properties`; delete stray `app/local.properties` from VCS.

2. **"docs: capture pilot readiness plan"**  
   *Rationale:* Provide leadership with status, backlog, and validation checklists ahead of pilot go/no-go.  
   *Diff summary:*  
   - `docs/pilot-readiness-report.md`: new report covering executive summary, backlog, proposed PRs, diff excerpts, test plan, security checklist, and go/no-go gates.

## Updated CI Configuration
See `.github/workflows/android-ci.yml` diff above for the expanded pipeline covering lint, ktlint, detekt, unit tests, release build, and artifact upload.

## Test Plan
### Given/When/Then Matrix
1. **Given** the kiosk boots for the first time, **when** an admin launches the hidden gesture, **then** the app forces PIN enrollment with entropy + rotation policy.
2. **Given** the scanner is idle, **when** a QR device engagement is presented, **then** the app performs ISO 18013-5 handshake over BLE and returns age-over decision without storing PII.
3. **Given** the trust list cache is stale, **when** network is unavailable, **then** the verifier blocks issuance and surfaces retry guidance.
4. **Given** the kiosk crashes unexpectedly, **when** the watchdog detects the inactivity window, **then** it relaunches `ScannerActivity` in lock task mode.

### Espresso / JUnit Snippets
```kotlin
@Test
fun lockTask_and_admin_unlock_flow() {
    grantPermission(Manifest.permission.CAMERA)
    launchActivity<ScannerActivity>().use { scenario ->
        scenario.onActivity { activity ->
            assertTrue(activity.isInLockTaskMode)
            performAdminGesture(activity.findViewById(R.id.scannerRoot))
        }
        onView(withId(R.id.pinEntry)).perform(typeText("123456"))
        onView(withId(R.id.confirmButton)).perform(click())
        intended(hasComponent(AdminActivity::class.java.name))
    }
}
```
```kotlin
@Test
fun trustList_staleCache_blocks_verification() = runTest {
    val repo = TrustListRepository(FakeApi(), clock = FixedClock())
    repo.cacheTrustList(staleList)
    val verifier = WalletVerifier(repo, coseVerifier)

    val result = verifier.verify(engagement)

    assertTrue(result is VerificationResult.StaleTrustList)
}
```

## Security Checklist
| Control | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Device owner & lock task enforced | ❌ Pending | Implement `DeviceAdminReceiver`, re-enter lock task on resume. |
| Admin PIN entropy & rotation | ❌ Pending | Enforce first-boot setup, 6–12 digits, 90-day rotation. |
| PII minimization | ⚠️ Partial | Need to drop subject identifiers post-verification; logs already structured. |
| Trust list freshness & revocation | ❌ Pending | Implement COSE/SD-JWT verification + stale cache eviction. |
| Crash recovery | ⚠️ Partial | Watchdog restarts activity; add process-level restart & ANR reporting. |
| Secure storage | ✅ Pass | Admin PIN already stored via `EncryptedSharedPreferences`. |

## Go / No-Go to Pilot Checklist
- ☑ CI pipeline green on `ciStaticAnalysis`, `ciUnitTest`, `assembleRelease`.
- ☐ Device admin / lock task hardening verified on physical kiosk.
- ☐ ISO 18013-5 BLE/NFC end-to-end path validated with partner wallet.
- ☐ Trust list + COSE/SD-JWT verification approved by security.
- ☐ Admin PIN first-boot onboarding tested with entropy + rotation policy.
- ☐ Espresso smoke tests pass on nightly emulator run with artifacts captured.
- ☑ Security checklist residual risks reviewed with compliance.
- ☐ Disaster recovery drill executed (crash loop, watchdog restart, remote unlock).
